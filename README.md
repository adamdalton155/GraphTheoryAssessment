# GraphTheoryAssessment

- Why this repository exists -
The purpose of this repository is to host my work, research and functions that is apart of the Graph Theory module assessment. 

- Whats included on this GitHub repository -
Within this repository is two Juypyter Notebooks. The first notebook discusses Heap Sort algorithm, answers the following questions 
'Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm', 'Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort' and finally an 
'explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort'. This notebook also implements a python function that shows how Heap Sort works.

The second notebook discusses the 'Graph Isomorphism problem', and similar to the 'Heap Sort' notebook, the following questions are answered. Firstly 
'Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.', 'Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures' and finally 
'Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem'.

- How to run these notebooks -
To run these notebooks you must have Python installed. Then open a terminal/command prompt window and install Jupyter Notebook by running the 
command pip install notebook. After installation, create a folder anywhere on your Mac/PC, open a terminal/command prompt and run this command 
git clone https://github.com/adamdalton155/GraphTheoryAssessment. Once that has completed change directory into the GraphTheoryAssessment folder and enter 
the command jupyter notebook. A localhost window will open on your browser with two files visible. 'heap-sort.ipynb' and 'graph-isomorphism.ipynb'
